<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Black Student Union (BSU) hosted a community conversation at the Davis Center on Nov. 12 in response to recent bias incidents on campus. This semester, five students have made <a href="https://williamsrecord.com/471046/news/students-harassed-on-hoxsey-fourth-bias-incident-announced-this-year/">reports</a> to Campus Safety Services (CSS) of individuals in passing cars shouting racial slurs at Black students. More students told the <i>Record</i> that they experienced similar harassment but did not make an official CSS report.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the gathering, students shared personal experiences and ideas for combatting racial discrimination on campus. A similar informal gathering of students took place the day before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originally, instead of the student gathering, the BSU had planned to host a town hall where students would have the opportunity to talk to CSS Director Jeff Palmer, Berkshire County District Attorney Timothy J. Shugrue, and Williamstown Police Department (WPD) Chief of Police Mike Ziemba about their concerns and experiences, discuss the <a href="https://williamsrecord.com/468820/news/college-publishes-campus-surveillance-camera-policy/">campus surveillance camera policy</a>, and the possibility of increasing surveillance and implementing cameras along Route 2, according to BSU Co-Chair Jeffrey Zigbuo ’26. “The first step is dialogue,” Zigbuo said in an interview with the <i>Record</i>. “That was what my goal was — dialogue between the student body and the three people who actually have the ability to work with us and actually create effective change.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The town hall, originally planned for Nov. 12, was postponed to allow further discussion among students first, according to Zigbuo. “It was postponed to give students enough time to gather their thoughts,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The BSU will host a town hall in the spring, Assistant Vice President for Campus Engagement and Director of the Davis Center (DC) Bilal W. Ansari wrote in an email to the <i>Record</i>. “The leadership of BSU asked for the creation of a safe space to unpack the impact of so many incidents this semester… [The DC] gave support,” Ansari wrote in an email to the <i>Record</i>. “As a result, this Spring semester a BSU Town Hall is being planned to discuss implications and possible institutional demands.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In interviews with the <i>Record</i>, Black students shared their experiences of racial harassment both in Town and by students at the College and expressed concerns about the campus community’s response.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Taahira Garnes ’28 recounted being targeted on Route 2 by a bike gang who shouted racially and sexually explicit comments at her. “It made me really upset and I felt myself getting emotional,” she wrote in a message to the <i>Record</i>. “I wasn’t sure why. I’ve experienced racism my whole life but I think it was a reminder that it follows me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These incidents are not isolated to Route 2 but reflect experiences on campus as well, students said. “What’s most upsetting is that these acts of hate aren’t exclusive to the broader community but also within this purple bubble,” Garnes wrote. “I’ve gotten weird looks and remarks. I once overheard a group of white boys walking from Hoxsey talking about my sister and I in a derogatory manner — referring to us as ‘that one’ and inserting a slur after.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The College receives a wide range of bias reports — some involving drive-by harassment on public roads and others occurring in classrooms, residence halls, or student groups, according to Vice President for Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Leticia S.E. Haynes ’99. The response differs depending on the situation, she continued.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our office historically adapts to whatever is going on,” Haynes said in an interview with the <i>Record</i>. “We don’t have one strategy or one practice that we engage in. We think about the needs of the community at any given time and try to adjust accordingly.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of that response, she said, includes helping students navigate the aftermath of experiencing harassment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“We try to understand what happened, and also oftentimes, if someone has identified themselves … we will follow up and encourage [them], if they haven’t, [to reach] out to CSS directly,” Haynes said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Davis Center similarly focuses on supporting and advising students who experience harassment, according to Ansari. “Students who were assaulted asked for particular support around holding assailants accountable,” he wrote in an email to the <i>Record</i>. “We gave advice.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Palmer said CSS responds by both supporting the victim and investigating the incident. “Generally speaking, our response is making sure the victim(s) is/are safe, providing support resources, gathering information, providing information to campus partners, and determining next steps, including if campus communication is warranted,” Palmer wrote in an email to the <i>Record</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s also important to pay attention to details during these kinds of incidents, so that you can provide as much information as possible to law enforcement or other entities you’re reporting to,” he continued.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">CSS has recently <a href="https://williamsrecord.com/470680/news/css-increases-presence-on-route-2-in-response-to-recent-bias-incidents/">increased its presence along Route 2</a> after receiving reports of racial harassment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Students, however, often do not report incidents.</span></p>
<p class="p1">One student, who has been granted anonymity due to concerns for their safety, said they were harassed by a group of students after leaving senior fall formal on Nov. 8.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I see some dudes in a car — white dudes — and one of them gets out of the car and asks me for my pizza,” the student told the <i>Record</i>. One of the students then called this student an anti-Black racial slur. The student did not report the incident to CSS, citing disillusionment with the response to such incidents. “It’s been happening the last couple years actually, and the school just consistently does nothing,” they said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students told the <i>Record</i> that the College’s lack of action against anti-Black harassment allows targeted incidents to </span><span class="s2">continue and fosters a culture of disrespect toward Black students on campus. The same anonymous student recounted how, during their first year at the College, they watched a group of white students trying on BSU sweatshirts and joking about them. “One of these girls is in one of my classes now, and I have to look at her, and I’m like, ‘Oh, I remember you,’” the student told the <i>Record</i>. “So I’ve never really felt safe on this campus because of stuff like that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Garnes emphasized that non-Black students must hold the campus community accountable for anti-Black hate. “It’s not okay to use slurs, and if you’re aware of people that are, stand for something,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Zigbuo said the BSU postponed the town hall in part due to disagreement among students on the value of continued dialogue with CSS, the College, and law enforcement without tangible action.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Amirah Parker ’26 expressed irritation at “conversations” without change. “It’s easy to sit in conversations and talk in hypotheticals instead of getting on the ground and facing what is actually happening,” she told the <i>Record</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Other students advocate for camera surveillance and support for Black students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sara Fevrier ’28 told the <i>Record</i> that she believes the responsibility currently falls excessively on Black students to catch and report the crimes. “We, as Williams College students, are so tired and exhausted,” Fevrier said. “When this stuff happened to me, I was also overwhelmed with work. We genuinely need help, and the burden of this shouldn’t be on the victims. Fevrier suggested involving members of Williams Black Alumni Network (WBAN) and increasing the physical presence of CSS officers on Route 2.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Garnes similarly proposed a middle ground that would increase CSS presence without expanding the role of WPD, an institution that she said has acted “mildly racist” toward Black students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For some students, this history does not preclude the use of certain safety measures that may involve the WPD, such as increased camera surveillance on Route 2. Cameras would fall under the supervision of the Town, meaning the College cannot install them unilaterally. “Any installation process and implementation policies regarding footage and data would need to be in conjunction with and require approval from the town,” Palmer wrote.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Some students, however, told the <i>Record</i> they are opposed to the idea of increased surveillance from either CSS or the WPD.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Haynes said that the College’s strategy to limit bias incidents involves working with organizations that are adjacent to the campus community, including the NAACP of Berkshire County, WPD, and the Town. “In terms of education, we have a very robust suite of workshops and educational programming that we also adapt, and we engage students in some of this work as peer educators, and we also bring people in from the outside to help us think through and talk about some of these challenges,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some students say these measures fall short. One student, who was granted anonymity out of concern for their safety, described experiencing a bias incident on Route 2 in fall 2024. “The day it happened, I remember … something being thrown at us really quickly,” said the student, referring to a bottle. “And then hearing the N-word from out the truck window, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The student described non-Black students’ reaction to this incident — which was reported by President Maud S. Mandel in an all-campus email without the students’ consent — as “lukewarm.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Students told the <i>Record</i> that experiencing racial harassment on campus is significantly psychologically damaging and traumatic. They also described a sense that racism is escalating on campuses nationwide.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Fevrier said she was called an anti-Black racial slur while crossing Route 2 as a first-year — her first time wearing an Afro on campus, something she decided never to do again. The incident occurred right after finishing an exam, and it subsequently impacted her mental health and her academic performance, she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">“I don’t think people understand the lingering fear,” Fevrier said. “You feel as if you’re being overdramatic for feeling the way you do. I was just so paranoid and felt so afraid and so small. It’s not just being called the word, it’s what it means for the future. I’m a person, you know? I’m a human being. And that hurts.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_471194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-471194" style="width: 886px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-471194" src="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764.jpg" alt="" width="886" height="664" srcset="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764.jpg 2001w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764-600x450.jpg 600w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764-768x576.jpg 768w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3764-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-471194" class="wp-caption-text">Janine Wang/<em>The Williams Record</em></figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lyceum — the formal student-faculty dinner typically hosted several times each year in the Faculty House — </span><span class="s2">will not take place this semester due to staffing shortages and a recent </span><span class="s3">major administrative restructuring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The administrators formerly grouped under the Office of Campus Life (OCL) are now split between the new Office of Student Life and Leadership (SLL), operations, and the president’s office. Vacancies in key SLL positions have especially hindered the planning of Lyceum, according to Assistant Director for Residential Education Zach Cramer. “The Office of Student Life and Leadership has been undergoing staffing and structural changes, and as a result, Lyceum has not been able to move forward this semester,” he wrote in an email to the<i> Record</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The College has yet to name a replacement for Doug Schiazza, the former associate dean of campus life who retired last spring. SSL similarly has no director of student life and leadership — a new position that was created following Schiazza’s departure and the split of OCL.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Lyceum is typically organized by the area coordinator for upperclass students. However, due to a reduction in the number of area coordinators and high turnover, that has not been the case this semester, according to Alex Dionne, who currently holds the position. “There were other things that needed my attention,” Dionne told the <i>Record</i>. “Unfortunately, Lyceum is something that we don’t have the staffing to accommodate right now … There’s never been enough stability in the Office for anyone to actually figure out what their job role is.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">This semester marks the second consecutive academic year that Lyceum has not been held according to its usual schedule. Last year, Lyceum was <a href="https://williamsrecord.com/468234/news/lyceum-dinners-delayed-in-wake-of-ocl-staffing-shortages/">delayed</a> amid OCL staffing shortages.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Doddceum, a more casual event similar to Lyceum that is hosted at Dodd House, is being held as usual, with four scheduled for the semester. Unlike Lyceum, Doddceum is planned by students on the Residential Life Team. The two do not share a budget, Dionne said. “Doddceum is in no way intending to make up for the lack of Lyceum,” he said. “Campus Life doesn’t actually pay for Lyceum … Lyceum is entirely funded by Dining. Campus Life’s support there was always just administrative… We haven’t been able to offer the administrative support.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Support from the administration is needed “to facilitate the sign-ups and collect the required dietary information and liaise the guest list with the people who signed up.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OCL expects that the two vacancies will be filled by the spring semester and that Lyceum will resume on a regular basis, according to Dionne. Cramer is also optimistic about the return of Lyceum.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_471168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-471168" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-471168" src="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Betty_Shamieh_headshot-cropped.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="438" srcset="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Betty_Shamieh_headshot-cropped.jpg 954w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Betty_Shamieh_headshot-cropped-600x564.jpg 600w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Betty_Shamieh_headshot-cropped-768x722.jpg 768w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Betty_Shamieh_headshot-cropped-300x282.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-471168" class="wp-caption-text">Betty Shamieh will speak at Claiming Williams Day on Feb. 5. (Photo courtesy of Betty Shamieh.)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Betty Shamieh, a Palestinian American author, will present a keynote speech during Claiming Williams Day on Feb. 5. Shamieh’s <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Too-Soon/Betty-Shamieh/9781668046548">most recent work, <i>Too Soon</i>,</a> is this year’s Williams Reads book. The contemporary novel follows the lives of three generations of Palestinian women as they face the tribulations of love, political exile, and familial pressures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In an interview with the <i>Record</i>, Shamieh discussed her background in playwriting, her upbringing in a Middle Eastern household, and the role of humor in political literature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Prior to writing <i>Too Soon</i>, Shamieh was an established playwright hoping to break into the television industry. “This book erupted out of me in a way that was really surprising,” she said. “After a decade of working in theatre, I was planning to break into a more lucrative field like television. Instead, I felt compelled to write this book with the expectation that it would just be something I did for me, because I wanted it to exist in the world. I wanted to understand [the characters’] relationships.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Despite her recognition in the theatre world, Shamieh’s journey to becoming a successful novelist was anything but linear. “I had a failed attempt at writing another novel,” she said. “I think it’s important that people, especially students, know that most people do not simply wake up one day and write a novel that is selected as a <i>People Magazine</i> Book of the Week on their first try.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It usually takes a lot of failure beforehand — trying and getting back up after you’ve been knocked down by rejection repeatedly,” she continued. “When people ask me what it feels like to be a writer, I tell them it’s akin to being a boxer. You get punched in the face, and you’ve got to get back up knowing you’re likely to get punched in the face again but doing it anyway. You’re not fighting another opponent per se, but you’re fighting despair. You’re beating back a version of yourself that wants to give up.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Shamieh explained that she is interested in portraying the shared aspects of the human condition. “For me, it is very interesting that all these cultures that seem so different are actually quite similar,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I grew up in a Middle Eastern household where there was a great emphasis on matchmaking and getting married,” Shamieh said. “When I moved to New York to become a theatre artist, I was surprised to find that many of the American women around me, once they starting to enter their mid-thirties, seemed desperate to find husbands in the same way that my grandmother was desperate to find me [a husband] when I was still in my twenties. Though it happened later in an American context, it seemed both cultures make women feel that their worth is tied to motherhood and fitting into cultural norms.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shamieh’s novel follows Arabella, a Palestinian American woman caught in a love triangle between two men — Aziz, a medic serving in Gaza, and Yoav, an Israeli American theatre artist. In an interview with <i>NPR</i>, Shamieh described her novel as a Palestinian American <i>Sex and the City</i>, touching on the same elements of comedy, relatability, and intrigue that made the series a touchstone for women in the early aughts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Although <i>Too Soon</i> is not autobiographical, Shamieh drew inspiration from her childhood growing up in a Palestinian American family living in San Francisco. “Almost my entire village immigrated to America in the 60s, [they] fled from war and economic destruction,” she said. “[The <i>Too Soon</i> characters are] more like a conglomerate of the women from my village of Ramallah specifically… There’s a salacious scene with a woman on a refugee boat. That’s not my grandmother’s story, but it’s a story I heard about another woman of her generation.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shamieh’s project was sparked in part by a desire for better representation in contemporary literature. “When I was growing up, the cultural landscape was different,” she said. “Before the emergence of superstars like Alice Walker and Amy Tan, it felt like there wasn’t much visibility for female writers of color, and they weren’t given the reverence that was afforded to white writers, especially men. And so I said, ‘Let me try to write the book that I needed as a kid, like my <i>Joy Luck Club </i>or <i>The Color Purple</i>.’”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">While the novel is set in 2012, Shamieh feels the current political moment has made it especially relevant today. “The power of literature is that it can reach people, if they are capable of being reached. My hope is that <i>Too Soon</i> is a book that can do that,” she said. “I have been writing plays about Palestinian identity, usually comedies, for a long time. Therefore, I’m used to my work dealing with very polarizing subject matter where there is a great diversity of opinions. I always look forward to engaging with that diversity of opinions, especially on college campuses like Williams.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shamieh’s work depicts the harrowing plight of refugees but tells their stories with humor, a move that ultimately humanizes the characters, she explained. “I think that people appreciate watching messy people, seeing somebody slip on a banana peel, metaphorically,” she said. “And all my characters keep slipping on banana peels. And it gets more and more intense as the story goes on.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">Her relatable, character-driven writing conveys a timeless story about contemporary conflict. “I don’t just write for this cultural moment,” she said. “I write about the human condition, and I hope that people see my [characters] as human. But, very clearly, the book is about the legacy of a people who are displaced because they are born a different religion. I don’t think that can not be political.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I think my existence as a Palestinian is politicized, so no matter what I write, it will have a political bend to it,” she said. Shamieh looks forward to discussing her work with a diverse audience at Claiming Williams and hopes to share her story with people who may not have otherwise picked up her book, she said. “As a reader, if you’re choosing not to read widely, that’s political. [If] you’re choosing to read widely, it’s also political,” she said.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In an op-ed, Wyatt Smith '27 argues for collective action over individual choices.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">That the choice to be vegan is considered a “personal ethical decision” says a lot about how successful our economic system is at obscuring and trivializing the moral stakes of consumer decisions. It doesn’t say much about what is at stake in the choice itself, or indeed, if what is at stake in that choice should be left to consumer discretion.</p>
<p class="p1">It is, of course, the case that veganism is a personal choice, but whether its status as such is a collective moral failing is another question, one about which I have nothing to say that you don’t already know. Everyone is at least dimly aware that conditions for animals in factory farms are <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/factory-farming-animal-cruelty">horrific</a>. Everyone knows that the extent to which one’s awareness is dim is willful, since footage of rows of pigs in crates gnawing on metal bars is a search away. And everyone knows that approximately all animal products, including those served in dining halls at the College, come from factory farms. So make no mistake, the case for veganism doesn’t rest on an argument against animal husbandry in the abstract, but on the way in which animals are treated in our historical time.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If any of you believe that it is okay to torment animals their entire lives in order to efficiently satisfy gustatory preferences, I think our disagreement is of the sort that is hard to resolve in an op-ed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1">So instead, I address those who, on reflection, condemn factory farming, but experience a curious sense of levity around the subject and a curious motivational disconnect between this judgment and going vegan. When this dissonance rises to the level of conscious awareness, it can usually be submerged with some half-hearted thoughts about how dumb animals are, some disbelief (surely nothing this horrific could be so normalized), and some fear of being lumped in with cringe animal liberation activists. That such considerations only submerge — never resolve — the dissonance is evidenced by the nervous laughter that abounds in conversations on the topic. Luckily, because most vegans and vegetarians, after being told off a few times, have internalized the view that whether one eats meat is a “personal ethical decision” and that there is nothing more obnoxious than moralizing on the subject, it rarely comes up.</p>
<p class="p1">Why is there a widespread disconnect between the belief that industrial agriculture treats animals horrifically and the choice to eat meat? If you really believed the former, how could the latter even be a question? When squarely facing this conundrum, some people, realizing the indefensibility of their position, reach for the conciliatory virtue of honesty by owning up to their crimes: I guess I’m just bad, I guess my beliefs about right and wrong are no match for my appetite. They try to make the evil unreal by naming it, since if it really were evil, surely it wouldn’t be possible to name it so casually (as if evil weren’t, as they say, banal, as if it were anything but the capacity to see a boot smooshing piglets down a corridor and then chortlingly recall that bacon is quite delicious, or else not see that boot in the first place because you don’t bother to spend five minutes looking online to see what the animal welfare fuss is about). Other people, glibly donning their consequentialist hat, point out that, since a single consumer’s demand has nebulous effects on the meat market, it doesn’t matter what they buy (the cow’s already dead!). And, on a meal plan at the College, one has double insulation (the dead cow’s already bought!). As if an acceptable response to one’s tininess before the immensity of the economy were to exempt oneself from responsibility to all the beings to whom one is connected by the economy.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve pulled these tricks myself. I’m ashamed of all the ways that I’ve allowed myself to forget where dairy and eggs come from. I’m done with that now. After many years as a vegetarian, today I’m a vegan. Personal shame, personal responsibility, personal rebirth as a vegan. Yes, it’s a pathetic snippet of self-narrativization, shameful in its own way. But it certainly beats the alternative: It’s evil, it’s banal, and it’s yummy!</p>
<p class="p1">Still, you are right to be dissatisfied with that call to action. If it’s the right thing to do, why is being a vegan shameful? I think vegans often feel shame, and ought to feel shame. It is the shame of needing to take a moral stand on an issue which is about as clear-cut as these things ever are and simultaneously knowing that it doesn’t really matter, it won’t really help — that the system doesn’t care what you think and doesn’t need your money. You are statistically insignificant; your demand signal washes out. And because your stand doesn’t matter to the animals, it seems like it could only matter to you; your fury and compassion, because impotent, become narcissistic, and you realize this with painful clarity, so you keep quiet and allow what initially was a moral stand to transform into an unthinking dietary habit. When the moral basis of veganism comes to the fore later on — at times when you are asked, or ask yourself, why you are vegan — it does so in attenuated form. The judgment that paying factory farms to abuse animals is wrong, period, has become a “personal ethical decision,” and you wouldn’t hold it against anyone else for seeing things differently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Vegans accept this peculiar framing because it allows them to hide away their moral stand — in their heart of hearts, they know they are not complicit<span class="s2"> — and exempts them from the unhappy position of needing to moralize without having anything to say in reply to the interlocutor who points out that you are just two little people whose consumer choices mean nothing to Big Meat; the unhappy position of knowing (not just holding the admittedly sensitive belief) that factory farms are wrong without knowing how to help.</span></p>
<p class="p1">If everyone chose to go vegan, that would be lovely, but it’s the wrong sort of solution to the problem. The problem is principally that you <i>have</i> the choice of eating factory farmed animals. Factory farms need to be regulated out of existence. An industry that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7401590/">castrates 94 million piglets</a> each year without the use of anesthesia or painkillers needs to be regulated out of existence. That is hard to foresee happening anytime soon, but there is no reason why we can’t take collective action now on a smaller scale, as a <span class="s1">college, by requesting that Dining Services transition to serving only vegan food. The many reasons why individuals should go vegan also apply to institutions — to reduce demand for animal products, to mitigate climate change, out of intrinsic respect for animal lives, and to generate political will for factory farm legislation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1">Going vegan as an institution would clarify that ending our food system’s mass cruelty to animals is a political issue that cannot and need not be addressed within the paradigm of individuals, one by one, realizing that cruelty to animals is wrong even if the animal isn’t a dog. Our shared dining halls give us an opportunity to begin moving beyond the consumer choice model of whether it is okay to treat animals like things, in a way that would prefigure the political action that ultimately will be required to end factory farming. We need to do this, not as 2,000 individuals struggling to impose our higher principles upon our appetites day after day, but by coming together as a collective, getting straight to what really matters, and voting in a referendum.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to convince the administration to put this to a referendum, we’ll need signatures, so if you think that Dining Services should transition to fully plant-based catering, please sign your name on the petition accessible through the QR code below. In conversations with people about this proposal over the past week, I found that many people agreed with it in the abstract, but were hesitant to sign because they thought it was bound to be unpopular, and so signing was pointless. I have no guarantee it will work, but it is up to us, and I don’t think it is pointless to give your name to what you think is right in the faith that your peers will too.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The theatre department's production of "Into the Woods" dazzled audiences this past weekend.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_471132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-471132" style="width: 2001px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-471132" src="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988.jpg" alt="" width="2001" height="1334" srcset="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988.jpg 2001w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988-600x400.jpg 600w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988-768x512.jpg 768w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4988-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2001px) 100vw, 2001px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-471132" class="wp-caption-text">The show’s vibrant costumes were hand made by students in the costume shop.

<p>With soprano arias, eclectic costuming, and intricate set design, the theatre department’s production of <i>Into the Woods</i> transported audiences out of the Purple Valley and into the world of the Brothers Grimm. The musical, written by James Lapine and composed and lyricized by Stephen Sondheim ’50, elaborately interweaves various Western fairy tales. The production, directed by Visiting Lecturer in Theatre Michael T. Williams, unfolded at the ’62 Center for Theatre and Dance last Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><i>Into the Woods</i> is broken up into two acts, with a total run time of approximately two hours and 45 minutes. The first act follows each of the characters’ journeys into the woods, as the title suggests, and generally follows predictable story resolutions. Cinderella, played by Emma Hennessy ’26, finds her Prince Charming, played by Daniel Chanis Carrizo ’29. Little Red Riding Hood, played by Miriya Yeung ’29, is eaten by, and subsequently rescued from, the Wolf, also played by Carrizo. Jack, played by Avram Shapiro ’28, gets the beans, climbs the beanstalk, and returns with heaps of gold. The entire story, however, is driven by a baker, played by Dash Alschuler-Pierce ’28, and his wife, Emily Singer ’28, as the couple seeks to break the curse of childlessness cast on them by the witch, played by Maya Ray ’29.</p>
<p>Act I concludes happily ever after, with the stories tied up neatly — or so it seems. Following the act’s final song, “Finale: Ever After,” the narrator, played by Ben Zobian ’27, appends a cheeky “to be continued.” The latter portion of the musical follows the characters as they navigate the consequences of their so-called happy endings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Williams explained in his director’s note that he chose <i>Into the Woods</i> for its relevance to the lives of young people at the College. “Like the characters who venture into the woods, students here are in the midst of journeys that begin with wishes and end with discoveries — sometimes joyful, sometimes painful, always transformative,” he wrote. “Fairy tales promise happily-ever-after, but Sondheim reminds us that growth rarely follows a neat path. The woods test us, stretch us, and ultimately teach us how to live with one another.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sondheim, who turned these rote fairy tales into something far more human, died in 2021. At the College, he was active in Cap &amp; Bells, and in the Class of 1950 yearbook, he was voted most versatile, most brilliant, most likely to succeed, most done for Williams, and most original. He wrote the lyrics for his first two Broadway shows, <i>West Side Story</i> and <i>Gypsy, </i>just seven years after graduating. “A lot of Sondheim’s music is … emotional portraiture,” Perde said. “That’s what a lot of the songs in <i>Into the Woods</i> are trying to get you, a better sense of the characters in another way.”</p>
<p>The theatre department requires majors to participate in a minimum of four productions during their time at the College. Like many shows, <i>Into the Woods</i> drew from veterans of the College’s theatre scene, as well as students who were simply interested in joining the production.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Putting on a musical of this scale required an intense artistic process, explained Abdiel Perde ’28, who played Rapunzel’s prince. “Our director, he gave us all actor homework at the beginning, which is basically to do those things like come up with your character name, find out how old you are, describe yourself, the adjectives, things of that nature,” he said. “So [when performing] I just go over those questions and try to center myself, and try to leave behind AP [Abdiel Perde].”</p>
<p>Part of the challenge of acting is making every choice seem natural and appropriate, Alschuler-Pierce explained. “I think about the lines, and I listen to who I’m talking with, who’s in the scene, and I just listen to the words and abide by the text,” he said. “And before doing that, I arrive at the scene, I try to ground myself and make sure that I’m present and that I’m focusing on what’s at hand.”</p>
<p>“A song is no different than doing a monologue,” Alschuler-Pierce continued. “It’s yours, and in a musical, you’re [still] thinking on the line.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Rehearsing with costumes, set, and tech makes getting into character more natural, Shapiro said. “I always find it easier to act once all of the technical elements come through,” he said. “It’s so superficial, but in the rehearsal process, it’s just so much harder to immerse yourself, somehow, when all of the other stuff isn’t there, and then once it is there, you can yourself believe it more.”</p>
<p>Costuming for the show was extensive: Many of the pieces were hand made by the student-staffed costume shop, and each outfit was customized for the character, Perde explained. His costume, which included a brightly colored cape complete with a frill, heightened the absurd characterization of the prince.</p>
<p>Some of the roles and costuming even took inspiration from pop culture, according to Marlene Ruiz ’29, who played Florinda, one of Cinderella’s stepsisters. “When we were imagining how we wanted our characters to be, the director really wanted [the] step family to be like the Kardashians,” she said. “They’re a little bratty, a little pretentious, but it’s still kind of ridiculous.”</p>
<p>The set was also elaborate, made almost entirely of books. Tomes lined the railing of the balcony, framing a construction almost entirely plastered in pages. In a particularly impressive feat, the Wolf in Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother’s house lay in a roll-out bed that hid in the walls of the set.</p>
<p>According to Ruiz, joining <i>Into the Woods</i> helped her lay down roots during her first semester at the College. “I’m used to theatre, and it was kind of my passion project in high school,” she said. “So it’s a nice thing that can help ground myself for this first semester.”</p>
<p>Perde’s favorite parts of the production process were spending time with his fellow cast members and supporting their hard work. “I love the community aspect of it,” he said. “As a cast, we’ve been able to build our own family because of this show… Then to also present the work together [to] other people is really rewarding.”</p>
<p>For Williams, the opportunity to work with dedicated students has been a highlight, he explained in an email to the <i>Record</i>. “The cast, crew, and creative team approached the material with such generosity and imagination, and the support from the campus community and the ’62 Center for Theatre and Dance has been remarkable,” he wrote. “It’s been a privilege to make something this ambitious together.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_471141" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-471141" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-471141" src="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim-600x323.webp" alt="" width="600" height="323" srcset="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim-600x323.webp 600w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim-1200x646.webp 1200w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim-768x414.webp 768w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim-1536x827.webp 1536w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim-300x162.webp 300w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/womensswim.webp 1950w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-471141" class="wp-caption-text">Women&#8217;s swim and dive started off their season on a high note, securing two home victories over the weekend. (Photo courtesy of Sports Information).</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The home stands shook on Saturday afternoon as the Ephs walked out onto the Samuelson-Muir pool deck. Clapping in sync with each step they took, the women’s swim team team split off from the men to form a circle, huddling to belt out their pre-meet cheers. Their energy carried into the water, as the defending NESCAC champions dominated their season opener tri-meet against Wesleyan and Springfield College, winning 187-105 and 188-95, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s swimmers won every event at the meet. But, for the captains, the opener was less about the scoreboard and more about settling into racing as a team. “It’s a meet where we really try to focus on the energy on deck,” co-captain Ruby Groves ’26 said. “[We’re] just focusing on getting back into racing, getting some of the rust off, and really trying to cultivate the team vibe and energy.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That energy was especially apparent to the first-years, who raced with the team for the first time on Saturday. “Being a senior, something really exciting about the first meet every year is getting to watch the freshmen have their first meet,” co-captain Gracie O’Connell ’26 said. “They brought so much energy. It’s so exciting to see that and [to see] the legacy continuing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Groves echoed the sentiment. “And they swam fast,” she added. “They crushed it.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One standout performance came from senior Lily Codd ’26, who went 10:22.23 in the 1000 freestyle to win by over 40 seconds. “It was really cool to see,” Nora Sherman ’29 said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The captains emphasized that much of the team’s success stems from the culture they build around each meet. Saturday’s synchronized-clapping walkout is part of a home-meet tradition that sets the tone before the team even enters the water, according to Groves. Even after the walkout, the ritual doesn’t stop. “We do a [full] team cheer, then the men do a cheer, and the women do our cheer,” O’Connell said. “So we’re doing at least three different cheers for every meet.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The team spirit prep starts even before race day. The night before every meet, the Ephs gather for snacks and a goal-sharing session — a tradition that helps them focus and stay connected prior to competition, according to O’Connell. “We share goals that we have personally, what we’re excited for, what we’re swimming,” O’Connell said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“One thing we always talk about is how important it is to know the team goals and also to know your teammates’ goals,” Groves added. “Everyone knows what everyone’s trying to accomplish. I think that’s really important.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">One of the team’s long-standing goals is to be the loudest on deck. Even during the meet’s longest event, the cheering didn’t stop. “One [tradition] that I like is, ‘stand for the entire 1000.’ We really make it a team sport,” said O’Connell, who took second in the 1000 freestyle. “Everyone is up and cheering, even though we had three heats of it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“Whenever someone finishes and touches the wall we do a clap in sync,” Sherman said, emphasizing the team spirit that remains lively throughout the entire meet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Groves added that the path to success begins long before these battle cries echo through the pool house, when the Ephs’ captains set the team’s athletic foundation with six weeks of captain-led preseason training. “We start at about 3500 yards of practice, and by the end of preseason, we’re [at] 5500-plus yards per practice,” Groves added. “I think we did a good job with preseason, getting people into shape, and the transition has been fairly smooth.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Preseason traditions also brought the team together outside of the pool. Each Friday of preseason, instead of practice, the team held “Fun Friday,” where they tried everything from kickball to a slip-and-slide, according to Groves. “The whole team does it together,” O’Connell said. “It’s really important to our team’s successes that everyone knows each other super well and are good friends.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">On the final day of preseason, the upperclass swimmers unleashed their annual prank: Announcing an unusually difficult workout — usually a dreaded 400 IM set — before stopping the first-years after the first 50 and ending the practice with fun relays, including one where swimmers linked arms each relay lap until they were struggling to make it down the pool as a mass of six, according to Groves. “It’s sort of a joke where we [tell them] we’re going to do this really hard set, and then we just do fun stuff instead,” she said. “We’ve done that every year. It’s a fun way to end [the] preseason.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">For first-year swimmer Maggie Farley ’29, the preseason team-building made an immediate impression. “By the time the season actually started, we had been able to get to know the team really well, which has made training now that we’re in season a lot more enjoyable,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The camaraderie built through these moments strengthens the team socially and competitively, according to Groves. “That type of environment is a good way to really set the foundation of team cohesion,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">“Even though I have only been here for a few months, the women’s team is super close and is always there to pick each other up and cheer each other on,” Sherman added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fueled by Saturday’s dominant opener and the team cohesion built through months of preseason and team traditions, the women now turn their attention to the road ahead — beginning with a home meet against No. 10 Tufts, Trinity, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute this Saturday. “We’re looking forward to hosting a competitive meet against Tufts next weekend, and ultimately hoping to win another NESCAC title this season,” Groves said.</span></p>

<p>Surrounded by the brown wooden shelves in Perry Library, student groups Southwest Asian and North African Student Union (SWANA) and WCFM hosted an open mic night on Friday evening. Students were free to perform music of any genre or origin, with just one requirement: no English.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>“WCFM does a lot of open mic nights, so I had an idea to do one that was not in English, where people [could] sing songs either from their culture or from another,” said SWANA Co-President Leila Ruser ’27. Performance pieces ranged from Spanish pop folk songs like “Hasta la Raíz” by Natalia Lafourcade to timeless Persian classics like “Soltane Ghalbha” by Aref.</p>
<p>SWANA and WCFM worked together to make the event a social middle ground between a party and an academic event, Ruser explained. “I think [we] need more fun, cultural events because we have a lot of talks, and then on the other side of that we have a lot of parties, but there’s not a lot of in-between stuff,” she said. “So I was thinking it would be cool to do an event that’s more formal than a party but less educational than a talk, and people just listen to music that they wouldn’t have otherwise listened to.”</p>
<p>Jose Diaz ’29, a performer at the open mic, explained the importance of hosting events around campus for multilingual students. “Singing is a really important part of my life — I’ve always sang,” he said. “Spanish is my first language, so it’s easier for me [to sing in] than English. I just feel like every opportunity to sing is so important, and that’s why I chose to perform, since there are only so many of those.”</p>
<p>Although the performers were limited in numbers, the audience greatly appreciated the event. “It was really cool,” Michelle Yang ’28 said after attending the open mic. “Since I know some Spanish, it was great to see the artists perform, and I loved following along with the lyrics. There’s something really cool about people sharing something from their own language because sometimes things can’t really be translated into English, but you can hear the emotion through the music.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Every performance was followed by hearty applause and cheers from the audience. “I loved Jose’s performance, since I’m sure people who didn’t really know Spanish could also feel what he was saying just from his voice, which was very emotional,” Yang continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>WCFM recorded the show to broadcast later on-air, allowing the performances to reach the wider College and Town communities. WCFM has been hosting open mic nights more regularly this semester, and this was their first collaboration with SWANA.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>According to Ruser, SWANA has taken an increasingly active and involved approach to hosting events over the past two years, since the club was reinvigorated. “My freshman year, [SWANA] got revived,” she explained, “And then I became co-president, with the other Laila [Idbraim ’27] last year, my sophomore year. So we’ve been really more active this year and last year.”</p>
<p>SWANA hopes to keep organizing similar multicultural events to encourage students to engage with cultures and languages beyond their own and to provide space for more students to perform. “I think we could do something like this every semester even … [and] I wish that more people [would] sign up to perform,” Ruser said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In an op-ed, Pamela S. Jennings '78 expresses concerns over the College's decisions regarding principles of equity and reaffirms the importance of affirmative action.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a Williams alum deeply committed to the values that the College once articulated with pride, I write with concern about Williams’ <a href="https://williamsrecord.com/470677/news/faculty-votes-to-alter-handbook-remove-dei-references/">decision</a> to remove the language referencing discrimination and inclusion from its faculty handbook. Though this was a choice made so the College could recertify as a recipient of federal research funding, it is still deeply troubling. It betrays the very principles of equity, conscience, and critical reflection that institutions of higher learning are meant to uphold. Inclusion is not a matter of public relations — it is a measure of ethical integrity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">America is, in many ways, still at war over affirmative action, and white people as a group still don’t get it. Affirmative action should never have been turned into a controversy over Black students’ test scores or creative admissions policies designed to promote diversity. It became that way only because attention was diverted away from the real issue. The problem was never that Black students needed higher scores; the problem was that bias would have excluded us no matter how high those scores were. The real education needed in this country has always been in racial justice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I would like to see instead are lower bias scores — explicit and implicit — among white people. These tests, such as Harvard’s Implicit Association Test, <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">measure racial bias</a>. Those are the benchmarks that matter. We will no longer need affirmative action when those scores decline, because entrenched bias remains the only real obstacle to inclusion. But we are far from that point.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My professional experience also makes clear that test scores used for college admission overwhelmingly favor the lifestyles and educational backgrounds associated with white privilege. I know this professionally. As a psychologist who has administered and interpreted IQ and achievement tests for more than 40 years, I am intimately familiar with their construction and their limits. These tests are designed around cultural and experiential assumptions that align with white middle- and upper-class norms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1">Let’s also be clear: Affirmative action has not produced incompetence. In the years since affirmative action was introduced, there have been no scandals of Black physicians killing their patients or Black lawyers lying to their clients. The accusation of incompetence was always a stereotype. Affirmative action simply opens the door; what happens inside depends on individual merit, effort, and excellence.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Many have forgotten the role of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Bakke-decision">Allan Bakke</a> in the history of affirmative action. He was the white applicant whose 1978 Supreme Court case against the UC Davis School of Medicine became the defining challenge to race-conscious admissions. Was there anything admirable about being him? He still had to live with the knowledge that his scores didn’t even match those of his white peers. Psychology has long wrestled with questions about <i>norms</i> and representative sampling — whether it is valid or ethical to compare minority individuals to a large-group white norm when their small numbers are statistically diluted. It is far more appropriate to use norms that reflect the communities from which those individuals come. In that light, the Black students who gain admission through affirmative action are, by definition, at the top of their communities — talented, resilient, and likely to rise even higher in environments that genuinely support their gifts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Affirmative action is not a social indulgence; it is a moral correction. When institutions like the College retreat from naming discrimination and inclusion as core values, they risk aligning themselves with regression rather than progress. The measure of an institution’s greatness is not its endowment — it is its conscience.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The removal of inclusive language at the College, the national backlash against affirmative action, and the ongoing refusal to confront racial bias are all manifestations of the same underlying problem: a persistent unwillingness among predominantly white institutions to measure themselves by standards of equity rather than privilege. What may appear to be a pragmatic adjustment for funding or public image is, in truth, a moral retreat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_471163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-471163" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-471163" src="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs-600x387.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="387" srcset="https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs-600x387.jpg 600w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs-1200x773.jpg 1200w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs-768x495.jpg 768w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs-1536x990.jpg 1536w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs-300x193.jpg 300w, https://williamsrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kikhigs.jpg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-471163" class="wp-caption-text">Higgins finishes up another impressive field hockey season. (Photo courtesy of Kiki Higgins).</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NESCAC conference is regarded as one of the grittiest and most challenging in Div. III, and this is especially true of NESCAC field hockey, where half of this year’s NCAA Sweet Sixteen emerged from the small conference. Despite this tough competition, field hockey co-captain Kiki Higgins ’26 has managed to make a name for herself, helping the Ephs earn two Final Four appearances and two Sweet Sixteen appearances throughout her four seasons at the College. When the field hockey season is done, Higgins isn’t ­— she is also a defender on the College’s lacrosse team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teammates admire Higgins’ relentless work ethic and dedication. “I am in awe of her,” Keira Harder ’27 wrote in an email to the <i>Record</i>. “Her talent and leadership is unmatched, and she will do whatever it takes for our team to win. I have never met someone who combines determination, belief, and grit like she does.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Higgins has earned an array of honors at both the NESCAC and NCAA levels. During her first year, she earned the NESCAC field hockey Rookie of the Year title and a spot on the Synapse Sports National Div. III All-Rookie team. “No one is more deserving than her,” Harder wrote.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her sophomore season, Higgins was selected to the National Field Hockey Coaches Association (NFCHA) Div. III All-Region II First Team and the All-NESCAC First Team. She led the Ephs with 11 goals and 27 points.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During her junior year, Higgins repeated as an NFHCA All-Region II First Team and All-NESCAC First Team honoree while leading the team’s stat sheet with 16 assists and 34 points. She concluded the season with a spot on the NFCHA Div. III All-American First Team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Higgins was named co-captain of the field hockey team at the beginning of this season, a role that her teammates say she excels in. “She is always putting the team and her teammates before herself,” Laura Ryan ’27 wrote in a message to the <i>Record</i>. “That is why she is such an incredible captain, and an even better friend.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Her work ethic sets the tone for the team, and I know we all strive to be like her,” Harder wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This year, Higgins received the NESCAC Offensive Player of the Year title and made the All-NESCAC First Team once again. She led the team with 13 goals, seven assists, and 33 points. She was also named NESCAC Player of the Week on Oct. 27 and was recognized as the NFCHA Div. III Offensive Player of the Week two days later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1">Higgins’ teammates highlighted her humility despite her extensive list of accolades. “She is so humble and selfless,” Haley McAuslin ’27 said. “When we need to score, she makes it happen literally every time.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Higgins’ response to her success exemplifies her team-focused attitude. “It’s a true honor to receive these types of awards,” she said. “The wonderful thing about field hockey is that it is a team sport in that one person can’t just have success. It comes from the whole team.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originally a soccer player, Higgins began playing field hockey in middle school at the Noble and Greenough School. “I played soccer up until middle school,” she said. “[Nobles] offers a field hockey program, and a bunch of my sisters [and] my cousins all play field hockey, so I was like, ‘I’ll just try it.’ I tried it in middle school, loved it, and then I ended up playing club field hockey and committed to it then.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Higgins’ love for lacrosse was also inspired by her family. “I started lacrosse when I was very, very young,” Higgins said. “My dad was a lacrosse player in college. My siblings are lacrosse players as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While some might find Higgins’ athletic double-dipping daunting, she finds that lacrosse and field hockey are both worth the commitment. “They’re both team sports, and I think that’s what makes them so special,” she said. “That’s why I’ve stuck with playing these sports. It’s obviously fun, and I love playing the sport, but also the team environment and culture that getting here has created for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That same appreciation for team culture brought Higgins to the College in the first place. “My first time ever coming to campus … I talked to [Coach] Alix [Barrale], I talked to a bunch of the girls on the team, and you could just get a sense of the team culture that Alix had created and that the girls maintained,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That team culture has persisted during Higgins’ time at the College. “Everyone is really kind to each other,” she said. “[Everyone] makes practice so much fun, and it’s something that you look forward to going to every single day.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to her teammates, Higgins is a key part of this culture. “Kiki brings amazing energy to the team,” McAuslin said. “We have dance parties in the locker room before every game, and she’s always ready to sing her heart out and encourage others to dance, even pulling people in from outside of the dance circle to include them.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Higgins looks forward to concluding her senior year with another competitive season on the lacrosse team. Field hockey wrapped up its season with a 2-1 loss in double overtime to Tufts (17-3, 9-1 NESCAC) on Saturday. “I love being competitive,” she said. “I’m very upset and sad about the [field hockey] season ending, but I’m excited that I have a chance to compete in the spring.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Above all else, Higgins’s teammates will remember her qualities as an individual off of the field. “Though she is the best athlete I know, the most amazing things about Kiki have more to do with who she is rather than what she has accomplished,” Harder wrote. “She has so many of the intangibles that can’t be coached or taught. Her kindness, her bravery, and her loyalty are all what make her an incredible friend. I can only hope to be half the player and person she is.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In an op-ed, Melania Espinal '27 argues that student complaints are often aimed at the wrong things.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my first month or so at college, before I transferred to Williams, I was assigned to read Simone Weil’s essay “Human Personality.” Written right before she died and after she turned away from Marxism and converted to Christianity, Weil is responding to who she once was and what she once believed. At the time, reading it was a strange retreat from the denser stuff I was reading for other classes, even though it was a text with which I vehemently disagreed on most fronts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But since arriving to Williams as a transfer student, I have found myself coming back to “Human Personality.” This was mostly because I was struck by the number of casual complaints I heard in passing from other students. Ranging from the frustration of sharing a bathroom with strangers to comments concerning the quality of the food in the dining halls, issues with the College were prescribed to me before I could even experience them in full. They all seemed true to varying degrees, but all seemed utterly quotidian. I heard that the dining halls needed more to-go containers, the line for Snar was too long, how annoying it was to have a professor who doesn’t allow laptops in class — the list goes on. All of these complaints are annoying and commonplace and are somewhat true. What struck me about these complaints, however, was that they all rested on the experience of convenience. They were also not really about the substance of anything. They were just complaints regarding the quality of a particular thing — how something failed to meet a standard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">It felt utterly privileged to complain about the quality of the work of those on campus who, essentially, work for us. It is the case that there are at least 100 people making life at the College possible for any single student — whether it be the custodial staff, those who wash our dishes, or the grounds workers who clear leaves so that we may step with ease. Being a transfer student is a strange and uncomfortable experience for a myriad of reasons, but nothing prepares one for the dissonance one experiences when hearing these complaints while someone cooks, cleans, clears our walkways, replaces our light bulbs, and airs out rooms when they flood. It is so convenient and so full of ease to be here. It really makes me feel like I am living in the first world in the most extreme of instances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">And yet, arriving at Williams, I experienced a sort of discontent, but not the kind students initially expressed to me. I felt like I was coming up against nothing but myself. The only challenges I faced in my everyday life were concerning the will to study, finish work, or maybe get involved in an extracurricular or two: Nothing felt urgent. Unlike the “real world,” it was not my job at all to cook for anyone — including myself. It is not my job to clean the tables after they are used for dinner. Nobody really depends on me for their sustenance — and we don’t share a meaningful relationship with those on whom we depend for sustenance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">A charitable interpretation of my peers’ complaints might be that the pesky thing we are coming up against is not necessarily the standard of life here, but the fact that it is this convenient at all.</span><span class="s4"> It may be the case that this level of convenience offers us an inaccurate simulation of what our “real” lives might entail after graduation. Or worse, it affirms that a life after college is one with this mass convenience. Can we even claim this level of convenience is good for us? Does it teach us anything or ground us in the world? My instinct is no.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">It is easy to complain about what is convenient. Discontent usually comes from being uncared for. However, the discontent we experience at the College is of a different sort. This disconnect was also noted in an observation by Weil: “Whenever a man cries inwardly: ‘Why am I being hurt?’ &#8230; He is often mistaken when he tries to define the harm, and why and by whom it is being inflicted on him.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">It is a mistake to complain so tritely — specifically, to critique the ways the College has not provided a sufficiently excellent quality of life — without considering if such an easeful way of living is really fruitful. In what ways can a college education prepare you for any sort of future if it cannot confront you with anything but yourself? What does it say about the values the College is instilling in us if we are so willing and able to critique the work of those who are doing this necessary and everyday work? What culture is Williams creating beyond a culture of striving for the metric of excellence without any consideration of the substance of what or who we ought to be outside of the classroom? We only hope for extracurriculars to do that, but can we be convinced that the same type of necessity exists when I play music for the radio as opposed to when I have to labor for others (or even myself)?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Weil’s “Human Personality” is primarily concerned with different considerations of pain and what makes us believe we have the right to something good, something comfortable. Yet, whether or not we have comfort is somewhat ancillary in the case of life at the College. But, I think I am often mistaken in pointing to something trivial like the smell of my communal bathroom as the real reason why I might find the occasional dissatisfaction at Williams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Weil lays out what education should ideally do: “What is first needed is a system of public education capable of providing it, so far as possible, with means of expression; and next, a regime in which the public freedom of expression is characterized not so much by freedom as by an attentive silence in which this faint and inept cry can make itself heard; and finally, institutions are needed of a sort which will, so far as possible, put power into the hands of men who are able and anxious to hear and understand it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we are to be products of the ideal institution, we should be able to both experience and watch others experience these bouts of discomfort, pain, or annoyance and constructively work to understand why one feels this way — and also express our own pain more coherently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1">In other words, I am indebted to all of those who work for my ease on this campus and can never aim my discontent towards them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">And with all this mention of the essential work on this campus, I implore that you get involved with the Staff Faculty Initiative if you are anxious and willing to understand others’ discontentment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
