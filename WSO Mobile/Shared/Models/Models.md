# Models
This section contains code for things which are considered "models". That means that they "model" some state in a way that's useful. Usually, but not always, they come with some kind of bundling singleton class that contains a bunch of useful state and data with them.

I encourage you to be pragmatic with regards to deciding where your code should go in the tree. The only truly limiting factor is your imagination (and the ability of others to read your code)!
