# Services
These files define "services", or basically encapsulate WSO endpoints. They also bundle a bunch of useful helper classes and tools for working with that data.

If you're writing WSO-facing code, it should go here. If you're writing code that parses some endpoint, it goes here. If it's more general than that, then it belongs in Utilities or Models.
